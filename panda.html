            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear with a striking black-and-white coat and a bulky body.
            They have a large head, small eyes, long muzzle, large nose, and short tail.
            Their fur is white with black on the shoulders, legs, ears, and around the eyes.
            Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain homes.

            Giant pandas are medium to large sized bears. Males can grow to about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and weigh
            about 220 pounds (100 kilograms). Females are usually smaller.

            Giant pandas have large jaws with strong muscles and flat molars, which allow them to crush bamboo leaves
            and stems. They hold the stems with their front paws, which have enlarged wrist bones that act as thumbs for
            gripping.

        </p>

            Giant pandas are endemic to China. They live in bamboo forests in the mountains of central China. Severe
            threats from humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.
