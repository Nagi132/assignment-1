            Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world.
            They have muscular bodies, strong forelimbs, and large heads. Their tails are about half the length of
            their
            bodies.
            Tigers are usually orange or reddish orange with bold, uneven black stripes. Their stripes act as
            camouflage,
            making it difficult for them to be seen when they are among the trees and shrubs of the jungle.
        </p>

            Tigers are native to South and Southeast Asia, China, and the Russian Far East. Their habitat and
            numbers have
            dwindled rapidly.
        </p>

            Tigers are strong, powerful, and fast, which makes them lethal hunters. They can leap 26 to 32 feet in a
            single
            bound.
        </p>

            Tigers have been known to live to the age of 26 in the wild. Female tigers give birth to two to four
            cubs at a
            time, on average, and can do so every two years. About half of all cubs do not live more than two years.
