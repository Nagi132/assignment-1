        <p>The red panda is a small mammal with a bear-like body and thick reddish-brown fur.
            It is slightly larger than a domestic cat and has a white face with red-brown stripes from the eyes to the
            corners of the mouth.
            The red panda's belly and limbs are black, and it has white markings on the side of the head and above its
            small eyes.
            It has a long, striped tail that helps it maintain its balance.

            Red pandas are native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
            They are skilled climbers and use trees for shelter, to escape predators, and to sunbathe. Their ankles are
            extremely flexible, and they can climb straight down a tree headfirst. Their long, sharp, semi-retractable
            claws help them traverse tree branches easily
        </p>
        <p>
            Red pandas are also known as the lesser panda, panda, firefox, red cat-bear, or red bear-cat. Their
            scientific name is Ailurus fulgens.
